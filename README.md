som-toolboxr
============

R scripts for exploratory data analysis using SOM. I wanted to create a set of scripts that can take a data file, normalize it, checks for data inconsistencies and train an SOM. Also plots component plane visualizations, u-matrix and hit histograms. In short, tidying up and automating the scripts that I use when I get a data for the first time and want to understand how it behaves.
