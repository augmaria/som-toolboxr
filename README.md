som-toolboxr
============

R scripts for exploratory data analysis using SOM. Frequently, I start working on a dataset which I know little about (in terms of noise, feature relevance, natural groupings) and need something to give me a 'picture' of how the data behaves.

That is why I created these scripts that can take a data file, normalize it, check for data inconsistencies and train an SOM. They also plot component plane visualizations, u-matrix and hit histograms. Hopefully I will be able to get it to a state where I can do as much as I can do with Matlab som_toolbox and even more.
